Google Docs is a free office suite offered by 
Google~\cite{www-hid-sp18-601-gdoc-about}. It is a part of Google 
Drive, therefore cloud syncing is native. Google Docs is a collaborative tool
for creating and editing documents in real time. It allows for multiple users
to edit the same file. While it has apps in Android and iOS it only has PC
programs on Chrome Books.
