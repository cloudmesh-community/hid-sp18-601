After funding was cut SETI lauched SETI-MVAt Home, a public volunteer computer 
via the internet. Using this software users donate idle CPU time for SETI to do 
calculations~\cite{www-hid-sp18-601-sathome-about}. It was released in 1999 and 
one of its goals was to prove the viability of volunteer computing. This goal 
has succeded completly. SETI-MVAt 
Home was one of the inspirations for a similar project CERN did for the LHC.
