After funding was cut SETI lauched SETI$@$Home, a public volunteer computer 
via the internet. Using this software users donate idle CPU time for SETI to do 
calculations~\cite{www-hid-sp18-601-sathome-about}. It was released in 1999 and 
one of its goals was to prove the viability of volunteer computing. This goal 
has succeded completly. SETI$@$Home was inspiration for several similar projects
 ~\cite{www-hid-sp18-601-boinc-projects}, one of each is the 
 LHC$@$home~\cite{www-hid-sp18-601-lhc-at-home-history}.
