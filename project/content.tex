\section{Introduction}\label{hid-sp18-601-project-section-introduction}

CompuCell3D uses Cellular Potts Model (CPM) to simulate systems containing 
cell 
structures~\cite{hid-sp18-601-paper-swat2012multi}, be them biological or not.
 In it cells are made up of voxels, each cell has an unique ID and have energies
 associated with it~\cite{hid-sp18-601-paper-glazier1993simulation}.

The biological system for which CPM was developed was the separation of hydra 
tissues~\cite{hid-sp18-601-paper-glazier1993simulation}. The energy hamiltonian 
for this system had to have contact energy in order for the cells to separate. 
Since cells have a typical volume it also had to have an energy term related to 
the cells' volume, so that they would not  deviate much from it or disapear. 
It is
\begin{equation}\label{hid-sp18-601-equation-cpm-orig-hamiltonian}
H = \sum_i \sum_{j_n} J(\tau_{\sigma(i)},\tau_{\sigma(j)
})(1 - \delta(\sigma_i,\sigma_j)) + \sum_{c}\lambda_{c}\left(V_{c
} - V^{TG}_{c}\right)^2\,\,.
\end{equation}
The first term is the contact energy, the second volume energy. In the first 
term the double sum is made on cell pixels and that pixel neighbours. In 
the second term the sum is made on cells. The energy magnitude is defined
by \textit{J} and $\lambda$.
